Migrate to bazel.

Add unit tests.

Check if an inverse complement needs to be taken near the end
of postprocess.py. (See inline TODO comment.)

Implement multithreading in find_patterns.

Improve memory management in find_patterns.

Convert .fa and .ss files into a common format before running
the rest of the pipeline. Remove dependence of the pipeline
on the particular data format.


Remove dependancy of unit tests on our particular data files.

Properly handle command line switches.

Use @property everywhere.

Make different sets of scripts of .fa and .ss. (There will probably
be a third format.) These scripts should contain only business
logic for reading specific file formats. All other logic
should be moved into library functions.

Clean up code so that it conforms to style guide.
