Change dashes to underscores in command line arguments.

If there are enough pattern strings (around 2000) and if
we feed only wildcards, then find_pattern seg faults, probably
due to insufficient memory.

This is because the trie gets too big.

We should provide a command line option to disable annotations.
This way the trie nodes will stay small, at the expense of
less verbose output. A match record would just indicate
that some pattern was matched, without mentioing the pattern's
annotation.


Make --wildcard_limit a command line flag.


23 Jul: Just ran the mm10 data. It took 37 minutes. This
is the time to beat.


Currently, the matcher maintains a linked list of alive sliders.
When a slider dies, we remove it from the list and deallocate the
memory it occupies. Each time a new input character is fed
to the matcher, a new slider is created in a newly allocated
block of memory.

We could probably save a lot of memory allocations/deallocations
by maintaining a stack of dead slider objects. Rather than
creating a new slider at each new character, we simply grab
an already allocated one off the stack and populate it.
When a slider dies, we move it to the top of the stack. Moving
rather than allocating should save time.


Implement handling multiple input files, each on a separate
thread. Currently we build the trie once for each input
file, and this step is costly. We could save a few
minutes processing the genome by building the trie just
once and allowing each thread access to it.
